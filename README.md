# Kafka-traffic-dashboard-project

This project aims to improve personal skills in Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), Apache Kafka, and logs/observability of traffic, along with visualization using a real-time website traffic analytics dashboard.

## Objectives

- Gain practical experience with Kafka Streams and Kafka Connect.
- Enhance understanding of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA).
- Apply knowledge gained from reading ["Effective Kafka by Emil Kartov"](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Kafka-Hands-Event-Driven-Applications/dp/B0863R7MKG).
- Develop experience with logging and metrics tools, as well as state-of-the-art visualization using Grafana.
- Improve workflow with continuous documentation and research.
- Increase knowledge of benchmarking and testing tools with synthetic traffic data platforms.
- Enhance practical understanding of schema registries.
- Showcase Kubernetes skills acquired from preparation for the CKA certificate.

## Functionality

The project is designed to run locally using Kubernetes, with testing and usage exclusively through manual user entries and synthetic traffic generated by custom-developed scripts.

The functionality consists of three major parts:

1. **Web Interface**: A user interface that interacts with the backend through REST endpoints.
2. **Backend**: Designed with EDA principles, using Kafka as the Event Store.
3. **Dashboard**: Provides visualizations of the current and previous states of the application, offering insights into website traffic patterns.
